        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I was born and raised in Washington D.C. where I attended Maret School from fourth grade through senior year.
            I then matriculated at Harvard College where I have pursued my interests spanning engineering and technology, as well as history and politics.
        </p>
        <p1>I have a passion for hands-on oportunities to design and fabricate solutions to challenging problems. 
            From underwater remotely-operated vehicles, to supersonic unmanned aircraft, to CubeSats in Earth orbit,
            my interests span every domain, but with a particular passion for space exploration.
        </p1>
