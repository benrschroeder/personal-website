        <p>Project Overview:</p>
        <p1>The Harvard Rocket Propulsion Group is a student-led engineering team within Harvard's SEDS chapter. Our mission is to develop increasingly ambitious liquid bipropellant propulsion systems from spark torch igniters, to full-scale, flight-configuration engines. Our goal is to provide passionate student engineers with industry-applicable experience in the design, manufacturing, hot fire, and test flight of propulsion systems, and to expand Harvard's footprint into the aerospace landscape.</p1>

        <p3>Technical Overview and Presentation:</p3>
        <p4>With similar projects having been previously rejected by Harvard administrators, I sought to compile a comprehensive and compelling technical outline for the project demonstrating its balance of feasibility and ambition. I conducted an extensive propulsion literature review and interviewed more than two dozen collegiate and industry experts to construct a 60-slide outline for HRPG. I presented this outline to administrators at the Harvard Engineering and the EH&S Office. After receiving approval, I recruited a team of 12 and raised $8000 toward HRPG's first project: a gas/liquid heatsink spark torch ignitor.</p4>

        <p6>Phase 0: Spark Torch Igniter</p6>
        <p7>Phase 0 is the first of HRPG's three propulsion objectives. It's goal is to construct a feed system and test stand for a 10 lbf igniter fueled with gaseous oxygen and nitrogen-pressurized ethanol. This phase of the project will allow us to establish competency in the core technical demands of a rocket engine test stand: fuel feed and storage, injection, ignition, and data collection.</p7>

        <p8>Phase 1-Phase 2: Full Scale Rocket Engines</p8>
        <p9>Phase 1 and 2 will comprise of full scale liquid bipropellant engines exploring advanced cooling, fuel injection, and a flight-configuration feed system. Phase 1 will comprise, a pintle injector and an ablative or heat sink-cooled combustion chamber. The feed system will be constructed for configuration into a launch vehicle targetting 5-10,000 ft. Phase 2 will further explore coaxial swirl injection, regenerative cooling.</p9>
