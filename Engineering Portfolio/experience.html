        <p>Harvard College Consulting Group
            <p1>Associate (2020-Present)
                <p2>
                    Across three semesters with the Harvard College Consulting Group I participated in six-person teams to provide a go-to market strategy to an international software and video game developer, a partnership strategy for a major government administration, and a digital transformation strategy for a Fortune 50 financial services firm. I conducted internal and expert interviews, large-scale surveys, and synthesized this research into recommendations presented to high-level executives and leaders at each client.

                            <p5>
                                In the Fall of 2021 I led a seven-person research team in partnership with the Department of Defense to produce a comprehensive policy paper on security challenges in the Gulf of Guinea region. During this engagement, we conducted interviews with experts from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and the office of the Secretary of Defense. In February of 2022 we presented our findings to members of the Office of the Secretary of State and their coworkers and submitted our 30-page policy report to their team.
