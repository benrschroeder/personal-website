        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I was born and raised in Washington D.C. where I attended Maret School from fourth grade through senior year. There I cultivated my passions for aerospace engineering and history. I then matriculated at Harvard College where I have pursued my interests spanning engineering and technology, as well as history and politics.
        </p>
        <p1>I have a passion for hands-on, team-based opportunities to solve thought-provoking technical and policy problems. From underwater remotely-operated vehicles, to CubeSats in Earth orbit, to foreign policy recommendations for the Pentagon, my interests span every domain, but with a particular passion for space exploration.
